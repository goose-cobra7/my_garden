## My Name Is Eran Yadin
![my pic.jpg|310x305](/img/user/my%20pic.jpg)

I'm currently studying electrical engineering and I'm a passionate tech enthusiast.  
Most of my free time is spent studying, working on personal projects (some tech-related, some artistic), and playing video games.

## My Background

I live in Israel.  
I finished school with a focus on biology and mechanical robotics, then went on to serve in the navy.

During my time in the navy, specializing in navigation, radar, and general duties as an [Ordinary Seaman (OS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_seaman). I also had the opportunity to train in firefighting at sea and gained experience in many other fascinating areas.

After completing my service, I started working as a welder in a metal workshop in the north. I quickly transitioned into roles involving laser CNC and [laser welding](https://weldingproperty.com/what-is-laser-welding). I learned [TIG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_tungsten_arc_welding), [MIG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_metal_arc_welding), and [arc welding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_welding)‚Äîmainly on stainless steel, but also on[ carbon steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_steel) and aluminum.

I really enjoyed the world of metalwork, and I still practice it from time to time.

Eventually, I decided to pursue a [degree in electrical engineering](https://www.ruppin.ac.il/en/faculties/ba/electric-engineering). As of August 2025, I‚Äôve just finished my first year.

My love for engineering started with my family‚Äîwe‚Äôre a family of mechanics, welders, and mechanical engineers. Conversations around engineering have always been part of our daily life. My interest in electrical engineering began during my time in the navy and grew stronger during my metalworking phase. That‚Äôs when I realized I wanted to understand it from the ground up.
