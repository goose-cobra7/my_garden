# CQB and CQC
**CQB** is an idea in of **C**lose-**Q**uarters **T**actics, how to clear small rooms, act fast and control the situation. most of the time CQB can be refer as “Room Clearing Tactics” (RCT).
according to [BCT](https://www.berettadefensetechnologies.com/cqb-army-gear-from-weapons-to-optics-beretta-defense-technologies/ ) there is **CQC** and **CQB**:
**CQB** is more about fire arm
while **CQC** stand for **C**lose-**Q**uarters **C**ombat and will involve more hand to hand combat knifes and self defense. it will be focused more on the arm reaching distance.

CQB have more focused on **speed**, **situational awareness** and **team work**:

## speed:
the operator will need to act fast have good reflex. they will have to make decision fast, life or death, shoot or threat, enemy or friendly.

## situational awareness:
the operator will have to understand the surrounding area as well as the human being around him. 
 which door is this, what could be behind it and what tactics of breach and entering should be used by the team. or in difficult situation: is the target is dangerous? can we solve it without shooting? 
 know your **physical** and **psychological** surrounding.

## team work:
when operator is in team they need to cover each other and work as a team to clear room efficiently. some time all operators are going to be in the same room clearing together and some times, when the room is tiny only few enter and the other cover their back. 
the team will need to be coordinated to move fest and to not cause accidental friendly fire and team or civilians.

## Single-person (Singleton) CQB
[singleton] is different from [team work]. while in team work, **fast entry** and **delay entry** will work *(delay entry: breach, flash, entry. fast entry: breach clear)* in singleton its **never** a safe option for fast entry. its always recommended to have delay entry.

> "Delayed entry tactics are more common in the law enforcement community and are designed to minimize your exposure and maximize the benefits of cover and concealment."  
> 
> "For single-person operations, delayed entry is generally a safer option than immediate entry."

the tactics of cleaning room **CQB singleton** different and take way more time to learn. no back up means every entry is more hard and single person will have to cover large area of [possible threat] point at the time of a full team.

## Deliberate tactics and Emergancy tactics
in short **deliberate tactics** refer to taking it slow, safe and cleaning every room fully assuring the safety of the members and civilian while minimizing damage to personal and objects.
**emergency tactics** are the opposite of it, move fast and finish the job even in the risk of operator getting hurt. the tactic mostly use if life are in danger and fast COA (course-of-action) is the solution. 
for [singleton] emergency tactics are **not recommended** but if needed, then speed is your best friend. move fast hit them quickly to hopefully surprise them.

> "Your best option is generally to move as quickly as possible and use speed as security, hoping that adversaries will not react fast enough to see you or shoot at you."

> "Because of the increased danger typical of single-person operations, deliberate tactics are generally the best option."

# tactics for clearing room
next we talk about breach tactics.
by this i mean talking on the most basic ones that are knowon if you want to know more you should look them up in your free time.
## the basic of clearing room
the idea of clearing rooms in team or with single is first and foremost exposing your enemies more then you exposes your self at any moment of the action. this will minimize the risk of you getting shot and will give you advantage over your enemies.
## clearing the room
in the room the door is the most dangerous part, this is why on go the team more as fest as possible spreading in the room and clearing. not allowing friendlies to be on the front barrel of the gun [^1] and not letting any part of the room stay hidden.

> [!quote] Title
> The entire team should enter the room as quickly and as smoothly as possible and clear the doorway immediately. a. The door is the focal point of anyone in the room. It is known as the "fatal funnel," because it focuses attention at the precise point where the individual team members are the most vulnerable. Moving into the room quickly reduces the chance that anyone will be hit by enemy fire directed at the doorway.

![CQB room clearing tactics-1.webp](/img/user/cabinet/pics/CQB%20room%20clearing%20tactics-1.webp)

in this picture we can observe the combatant get glimpse at the right corner of the room (while not fully) before entrance. then he proceed to get inside and clear the room from left to right and then counter clock.
the picture doesn't do Justise the act it self take matter of seconds for this size of a room.
we can see in this picture the combatant is alone and can suffer consequences from it, other combatant could do the exact entrance but from right to left and why not follow it with some tactics that we all ready learned and throw in flash to make the entrance deliberate and smooth.
![3 man CQB entrence-1.webp|469](/img/user/cabinet/pics/3%20man%20CQB%20entrence-1.webp)
in this picture we can see 3 combatant proceeding entrance to room using CQB tactics.
they each enter with their own role to fill, this way they cover the room fully in ease and in seconds. you probably wondering why non of them is looking at the left bottom corner of the room. this is because the first picture show the before and the second one show the ending of the procedure which contain checking this corner. it was num 1 role to go left from the door, 2 role was going to the right and 3 was going a bit to the left while looking forward and right .
you should also remember the left bottom conner is the most visible conner of them all at the first stages of the entrance, there for its all ready been checked.
from the second stage, after entrance and clearing done, **the leader (gold)** will proceed to send the info to the **commend center**, officer in charge and then proceed to the next targeted room.
### commend center
in SWAT the team have ground control or commend center they get to see all from a far make decision and help the beaching team. for example if wounded was found in the area, team leader will report. commend center get the report call ambulance and rescue team and wait for beach order that things are clear to proceed with the rescue. they can much more then just this but we will not cover it here.
## door breach
there are 2 ways to breach door (which is not just opening like normal person) 
![door breach.webp](/img/user/cabinet/pics/door%20breach.webp)
**handle** breach or **hinge** breach
### handle
in this tactic you shoot the handle area to make the lock go boom and break. this is very easy and some time work on first try, its good because well trained combatant can do it in first try and surprise the enemy. the bad side is the door is still here and not going any where which mean that the door can get in the way of your entrance or block you view to one of the side.
if you had the chance look on the doors that you have in your house, they all open to the same side, this way and by looking on the frame you can know to which direction the door open in matter of seconds.
### hinges
3 good shots with breach shotgun can do the trick this way the door fall flat and does interrupt with you entrance. there are other problems like tripping over and breaching unsuccessful.
### other method
there are other methods to breach door, Battering Ram for example. I'm not going to cover it here you can do some home work.
hoo ye one last thing because i know some people will point it up. no, kicking door is not easy, no you should not try it, and yes most of the time its not helping at all and can even cause more harm.
for example kicking old wooden door sound cool until you foot get stuck in it.
# head shot
i just want to point out that in CQB quick action and aim is not just important for taking down bad guys some time those skill are require to not kill the bad guy. this could be split second decision to aim lower so you can arrest the target. its important to understand that killing is not the mission of teams like SWAT but rather it is to put order where there isn't.
the trained combatant are learning not only to aim good and fast but also to where in each situation.
# honorable mentions
we can go on and on: combat tactics, hand signs, code word, guns and items even survival and DIY tactics. but i think this is enough, this assay took way too much time and ill maybe come back and revisit it, maybe even do part 2.
i do want to do more research like this on interesting topic and i will.

if you find any problems or mistake please tell me

[^1]:in CQB and in combat overall, when friendly is Infront of you, you point the barrel to the sky or to the ground or even to the side. this because the gun can miss click and fire, and moving the gun to safe mod is not practical mid combat.
