while going trough Pinterest like the bord I was. i found myself in aircraft and jets pictures section and stumble a cross this pic
![Mig-21 crosses the regional road which connecting the underground facility Cetin with the airport.webp](/img/user/cabinet/pics/Mig-21%20crosses%20the%20regional%20road%20which%20connecting%20the%20underground%20facility%20Cetin%20with%20the%20airport.webp)

and it fascinated me. i know that back in the soviet union the SSR army build roads meant to be taken off from and also turn into mini armory station for loading armament and fuel for airplanes. almost every big country used this tactic, USA and Germany, Pakistan, India and more
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_runway
but this picture was weird, this road is not look like any other "takeoff road" around the world, is uneven, with trees and cars. and the aircraft, MIG 21, look like is not even lining up but rather just crossing the road like any other car.
the aircraft is MIG 21 from the Croatia army.
on the pic other then the MIG and the car driving toward the camera all the others look like just civilian. 
i was curious and started quick research, which yield resulted very quickly.

but after a while:
[Airport Divulje Split (underground facility Cetina)]( https://www.balkanwarhistory.com/2017/06/airport-divulje-split-underground.html?m=1)
with the original picture and a description
read: "Mig-21 crosses the regional road which connecting the underground facility Cetin¬†with the airport"
so lets recap the story behind it.
the picture taken from road next to divulje airport. the MIG is crossing the road to get to an underground facility/ bunker. the bunker was build in 1969 to 1970.
Yugoslavia or the The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had bases all around the country and they planed to build [≈Ωeljava Air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/≈Ωeljava_Air_Base) (const' 1958 to 1968 ) which was very costly. so they also build much cheaper alternative under ground aircraft bunkers.
one of them, divulje bunker. 
Base Divulje was headquarters of the 784. The anti-submarine helicopter squadron of the YuAF
Until somewhere in 1974/5 this base was Central Marine Military School, Naval Academy, MEZ (Naval Electronic Institute). Later, until 1991. Training Center Marine commandos, helicopter units etc.

i could not find anything interesting around the bunker it self only around the Divulje base, which now act as helicopter base also for the fire department.

"Croatian MiG-21s being wheeled into the underground Divulje aerodrome (Circa 1990s). During the Yugoslav era, several subterranean hangars were built, with the largest at ≈Ωeljava Air Base capable of housing up to 80 aircraft."
