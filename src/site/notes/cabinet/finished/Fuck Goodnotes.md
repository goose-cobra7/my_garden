#drawer/blog 

When I started college, I went to the store and bought myself some notebooks for math and writing. Very quickly, I realized that notebooks are something from my dad‚Äôs decade‚Äîeveryone uses tablets now. (I mean, I knew tablets could be good, but for a college student in engineering, they're really a lifesaving tool.)

So, I went back, and after some discussion and research, I bought the Samsung tablet, which works amazingly. Next, I needed an app. Most of the students in my class use Apple tablets, so they also use their apps. After looking around, I found GoodNotes‚Äîan app with basic features and easy writing.

I got used to it and found myself dependent on it. Only one problem‚Äîit's terrible.

## Why use it then?

So, you‚Äôre asking: "Why use it then?"

First, I didn‚Äôt know any other options and needed to find a solution because I was late to the tablet era of my studies.

By the way, before I bought my tablet, I got a pen for my laptop to see if it was worth trying. For the price, it was a really good, quick short-term solution, but definitely not good for students in the long run‚Äîespecially if your tablet is more of a gimmick. A laptop with a pen just isn't built for heavy, daily use of this feature.

## The reason for GoodNotes

The app is simple and beautiful. It captures what a student really needs:

- Basic writing
- PDF annotation
- Highlighting
- Stickers
- Adding pictures

And my favorite feature: **scribble erase**‚Äîscribbling over your writing to erase it.

## The problem arises

The problem started when I realized that the app isn't built for Android at all‚Äîit's just a port. And, like a lot of ports nowadays, it's a really bad one.

It hasn‚Äôt been officially tested or optimized for Android; it‚Äôs literally just trying to emulate the iOS app. Every feature that can‚Äôt work on Android for some stupid reason was deleted. Even the most basic features that Apple users have are nowhere to be seen.

The app overall is unoptimized and unsupported. As I tried to find out if the issue was with my tablet, I came across a pile of complaints from other users‚Äîcomplaints that were never acknowledged. And it‚Äôs not just Android users who are frustrated.

## The field is empty

I wouldn‚Äôt have written this if I had found another app that could replace GoodNotes.

The problem is, most apps in this space cost too much just to try, or they‚Äôre packed with features I‚Äôd never use. They cram in unnecessary tools, creating a steep learning curve and making new users uneasy.

I was searching for a basic app‚Äîsomething so simple it only has the bare minimum while trying to replicate the feeling of writing on paper.

I'm going back to Samsung Notes.
